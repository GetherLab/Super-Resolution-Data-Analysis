# Super-Resolution-Data-Analysis
## The following code was used to generate the data presented in Cholesterol- and neuronal activity-dependent dopamine transporter nanodomains revealed by super-resolution microscopy

DBSCAN_main.R was used to identify clusteres and generate the "Percent of localizations found in clusters" that is used throughout the paper as a metric.

Total Cluster Analysis-Zeros.py can also be used to generate the % clustered data for each ROI, and it also generates a table containing the size of each cluster, with the clusters identified by image.

Density Based Analysis.py includes multiple ways to display the data to reflect the density of localizations throughout the region of interest

Colocalization viewer.py takes the information gathered through the LAMA super resolution microscopy toolbox and views it.

Lama can be downloaded from its homepage located here: http://user.uni-frankfurt.de/~malkusch/lama.html
