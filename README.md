# Super-Resolution-Data-Analysis
## The following code was used to generate the data presented in Cholesterol- and neuronal activity-dependent dopamine transporter nanodomains revealed by super-resolution microscopy

DBSCAN_main.R was used to identify clusteres and generate the "Percent of localizations found in clusters" that is used throughout the paper as a metric
